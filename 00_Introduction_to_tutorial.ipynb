    "Online data services, such as [Delpher](https://www.delpher.nl/), offer a wealth of information. In this tutorial, we will use computational methods to analyse and visualize a corpus of texts. Apart from basic preprocessing steps, we will use different methods to visualize a corpus and find interesting patterns. While this tutorial is in English, we will use and analyse a Dutch corpus.      \n",

    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "You don't need to have any programming experience to complete this tutorial. However, if it is your first time using Python and/or Jupyter Notebooks, we recommend you read through [this introduction](https://kbnlresearch.github.io/xml-workshop/1_introduction_python.html) before starting the tutorial. The next chapter will also provide a short introduction to Python and Jupyter Notebooks. \n",

    "### Lesson goals\n",
    "After finishing this tutorial, you will be able to:\n",
    "- Perform basic text analysis with Python, using a Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "- Inspect the retreived data with some basic text analysis and visualization techniques\n",
    "- Perform basic preprocessing steps to make your data more interpretable for machines\n",
    "- Conduct computational analysis on a corpus of texts, such as named entity recognition"
