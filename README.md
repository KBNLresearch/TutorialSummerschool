# Data Analysis Tutorial Summerschool
The Python notebooks in this repository are created for the KB Summer School.

We want to show the possibilities of using code to explore the paper article data by statistics and visualisation.

### Corpus
Online data services, such as [Delpher](https://www.delpher.nl/), offer a wealth of information. 
In this tutorial, we will use computational methods to analyse and visualize a corpus of texts. 
Apart from basic preprocessing steps, we will use different methods to visualize a corpus and find interesting patterns. 
While this tutorial is in English, we will use and analyse a Dutch corpus.      

Paper titles: 
* De Tijd
* De Standaard
* Het Vaderland

Year: 1873

### For whom?
The tutorial is aimed at researchers, PhD students and Master students in the Humanities.  

### Prerequisites
You don't need to have any programming experience to complete this tutorial. 
However, if it is your first time using Python and/or Jupyter Notebooks.

This project can be built with Binder, using the following 
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/KBNLresearch/TutorialSummerschool/mmo010-documentation).
This will give you your own temporary run time environment.

### Lesson goals
After finishing this tutorial, you will be able to:
- Perform basic text analysis with Python, using a Jupyter Notebook
- Inspect the retreived data with some basic text analysis and visualization techniques
- Perform basic preprocessing steps to make your data more interpretable for machines
- Conduct computational analysis on a corpus of texts, such as named entity recognition
